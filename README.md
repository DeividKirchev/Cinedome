The website includes a list of movies (including upcoming ones), a schedule for the next week, and a ticket page where the user can view and book seats.
The application uses MongoDB for a database, NextJS for SSR, and React for the front end. The main purpose is a beautiful modern UI with a nice user experience.
This is a sample project where I am practicing React. Thank you!
